<h1>3D Printer Project!</h1>
<p>This project is developed by Matthew Whitworth as an independent study class for Advanced Robotics: Selected Studies class. This project comes "as is" with no gurantee or warranty.</p>
</br>
<h1>Equipment</h1>
<p>The equipment used for this project is an original Prusa i3 that is running an Arduino MEGA 2560 with a RAMPS 1.4 header board on top of it. The Prusa has one heated extruder and a heated bed. An external analog thermistor is added for detecting and reading ambient temperature.</p>
<p>Full List of Printer Commands Supported is available at "GCODE Commands.txt"</p>

<h1>Steps to Install:</h1>
<p> Before we begin, please make sure to have either a printer machine controller, such as Simplify3D or Octoprint, installed on a system to be controlled before continuing.</p>
<p>1. Download the Arduino IDE Version 2.x.x</p>
<p>2. Install Arduino IDE</p>
<p>3. Give Read/Write Priviledges to Arduino if Arduino is not able to access USB already</p>
<p>4. Download the Latest Version of the Repository Under the Tags Section and Downloading the ZIP File.</p>
<p>5. Extract the Downloaded Repository</p>
<p>6. Open the Folder Called "3DPrintingSketch"</p>
<p>7. Open the File Called "3DPrintingSketch.ino"</p>
<p>8. Plug the Arduino into the Computer via USB</p>
<p>9. Proceed to Steps to Configure Before Continuing</p>
<p>10. In the upper left corner, click on the Arduino MEGA 2560 and press upload.</p>
<p>11. Test with Serial Communication and Octoprint is able to connect with the machine controller.</p>
<p>12. ENJOY!</p>
